# Lake Command Line Interface

## Getting started
LakeCLI its a command line made with python, it contains different built-in commands and the possibility to add addons.

### Requirements
- *Operative System*: Windows
- *Python version*:Python 3.X (Newer versions might need 3.10 or above due to new syntax)
- *Python libraries*:
	- termcolor
	- colorama
	- keyboard


### Installing
LakeCLI doesn't require any kind of installation, although, you can add it in a windows terminal profile with a command like this:
```powershell
python (location of the folder)\main.py --no-ctrlc:True
```

The `"--no-ctrlc"` avoids the shell from quitting after pressing `<Ctrl>` + `<C>`, its a recommended setting.
